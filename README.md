# Tensorflow-Installation
GPU Check and TensorFlow Installation #EXP-1

This repository contains a Python script for checking the availability of a GPU and installing TensorFlow with the appropriate version (CPU or GPU) based on the device's capabilities.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/aafiya-farveen/Tensorflow-Installation.git

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**

   ```bash
        cd Tensorflow-Installation
        
3. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**

Before executing the TensorFlow installation script, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can use the following pip command:
    
        pip install notebook
        
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
        jupyter notebook Tensorflow.ipynb
        
The Jupyter Notebook file (Tensorflow.ipynb) will check if TensorFlow is installed and install it if necessary. It will then determine if your device has a GPU and install the appropriate version of TensorFlow (CPU or GPU).
